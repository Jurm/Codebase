Rewrite module loader code if possible: The fact that it's using a case statement is likely a source of slowdown.

Sections that still need to be understood, add your name in brackets if you'll work on it:
    Admin control
    Module loading
        Newday process?
    Race modules
    Village code
    "Account" objects
    Database layout [Tahvohck]
